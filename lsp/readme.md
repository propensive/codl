# tel — the TEL command-line tool (and Language Server)

The `tel` executable, built in Scala with the Soundness ecosystem and packaged in the same style as
[Flame](https://github.com/propensive/flame) (Mill + an Ethereal self-fetching native launcher).

> **Build note:** Soundness now publishes only *bundles*, under the `dev.propensive` group, so this
> build depends on four of them — `soundness-base`, `soundness-data` (Stratiform), `soundness-cli`
> and `soundness-tool` (Exegesis) — rather than one artifact per library. The pinned version is
> **0.0.2-TEST**, a local build of Soundness `main` — which carries the LIRA schema-reference
> pragma grammar, Stratiform's schema-resolution engine (soundness#1841), and the TEL `key`
> fields, TELP paths and scalar codecs this server needs — resolved from `~/.ivy2/local`; override
> with `$SOUNDNESS_VERSION`. Reproduce it with
> `SOUNDNESS_RELEASE_VERSION=0.0.2-TEST ./mill 'soundness.{base,cli,data,sci,test,tool,web}.publishLocal'`
> in that worktree (the version must be given explicitly; the git-describe fallback picks up a stray
> tag). Only four bundles are depended on directly, but the bundle dependency graph pulls in `sci`,
> `test` and `web`, so all seven must be published or resolution fails.
>
> Soundness is built with the propensive Scala fork, and its TASTy is only readable by that
> compiler, so `scalaVersion`/`scalaRelease` here must match the values the Soundness build used —
> currently `3.9.0-RC5-p14` for both the coordinate and the release tag. The build downloads
> that release from [proscala](https://github.com/propensive/proscala) into a shared cache
> (`~/.cache/soundness/proscala/<tag>/lib`) — the same one the Soundness build uses — so no local
> compiler build is needed; set `$SOUNDNESS_SCALA_HOME` to a `make`-built `release` directory to
> override.

It is organised around subcommands:

- **`tel lsp`** — run a Language Server for [TEL](../readme.md) documents over stdio (what an editor
  launches).
- **`tel lsp --log`** — stream, live, the messages a running server sends/receives (a debugging aid).
- **`tel schema list`** — list registered schemas as a table (name, BASE-256 id, layers).
- **`tel schema add <file>`** — verify a schema and add it to the registry (relative paths resolve
  against the invoking shell's directory). Acceptance requires the full battery: conformance to the
  TELS meta-schema, Stratiform's §20.1 schema-validity checks over the layer-composed result
  (`Tels.Validation.validate` — duplicate keywords, layer rules, `key` constraints, …), and
  reference coherence (every `TypeName` must resolve, to a Definition of the right kind — E209 and
  E217, which Stratiform itself only discovers lazily when a document is validated against the
  schema). An incoherent schema is rejected rather than stored, so the registry can never hold a
  schema that will fail at use.
- **`tel schema signature <name> [layer…]`** — print the BASE-256 palimpsest for a schema composed
  with the named layers (in order; none = the base schema).
- **`tel validate <file> [--llm]`** — parse and validate a TEL file, reporting exactly the
  diagnostics the LSP would publish (the same `diagnose` call, including schema resolution against
  the registry), and exiting nonzero when any error is found. The default report is for humans:
  each problem quotes its source line with the offending span coloured and caret-underlined.
  `--llm` emits a quotation-free report — one line per problem, with 1-based line and column
  positions, the E-code and the message — the right shape to paste to (or pipe through) an LLM,
  which has the file and needs addresses, not excerpts.
- **`tel install`** — write (or refresh) the shell's tab-completion entry for `tel`.
- **`tel --help`** (or a bare `tel`) — usage, generated from the subcommand and flag declarations
  themselves rather than maintained by hand, so it cannot drift from the real interface.

### Tab completions

Every subcommand, flag and operand completes. Ethereal serves completions by re-running the
argument dispatch in *completion mode*, where the `execute` blocks are skipped, so everything the
shell offers must be registered outside them — that is the one rule the dispatch in
[`tel.TelServer.scala`](src/core/tel.TelServer.scala) is written around. What that buys:

- `tel <TAB>` — the subcommands, grouped and described.
- `tel lsp --<TAB>`, `tel validate --<TAB>` — only the flags that command accepts (`--log`,
  `--llm`), each with its description and short form; `--help`/`-h` everywhere.
- `tel schema signature <TAB>` — **the schemas the registry actually holds**, each described by its
  declared layers (or its signature, when it has none).
- `tel schema signature <name> <TAB>` — **that schema's layers**, in declaration order, minus any
  already given, since a layer may be selected only once. The completion menu is titled accordingly.
- `tel validate <TAB>`, `tel schema add <TAB>` — filenames, with `~` expansion and directory descent.

The registry is read through the *client's* environment rather than the daemon's, so
`XDG_CACHE_HOME=… tel schema signature <TAB>` completes against the registry that invocation will
actually use.

The schema **registry** lives at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tel/schemas` (`~/.cache/tel/schemas`), shared by the
CLI and the LSP: `tel schema add` populates it, and the LSP resolves a document's pragma schema against
it to validate ordinary documents (see below). The built-in **TELS** meta-schema is always
preloaded, so it appears in `list` (and is resolvable) even on a fresh cache.

Features so far:

- **Diagnostics** — published on open and on change (the editor's incremental edits are applied by
  `Lsp.listen`'s document store, so each change re-parses the spliced text). The document is parsed
  with [Stratiform](https://github.com/propensive/stratiform)'s TEL parser (`read[Tel]`) under an
  accrual boundary, and every `TelError` is reported with its spec E-code (e.g. `E104`, `E107`), its
  message, and a **source range**. Ranges come from Stratiform's position tracking (`import
  parsing.trackPositions`), and are *exact*: every located `TelError` carries a `Span` giving both
  the start and the extent of the offending text, so a diagnostic underlines the token itself — the
  bad pragma phrase, the trailing-space run, the misaligned indent, the offending compound's
  keyword — rather than a single character or a whole line. A parse error carries its own `span`; a
  schema/validation error's span is filled onto its `Tel.Focus` by `Tel.Type.assign` (via
  `Tel.supplementPositions`), and, failing that, the focus's keyword path is resolved against the
  position-tracked document with `tel.locate`. A *schema* document (one whose pragma names the `tels` meta-schema) is
  additionally validated against the built-in meta-schema (`Tels.Axiom.tels`), surfacing
  malformed-schema errors such as `E306` (unrecognised keyword); run through Stratiform's §20.1
  schema-validity battery over the layer-composed result (E201-E221); and checked for reference
  coherence (E209/E217, located on the offending `TypeName` atom). A local `E210` check covers
  duplicate (or built-in-colliding) definition names, which the battery's base side does not. Diagnostics are cleared when a document
  closes. A pragma naming an unregistered schema gets an `Information` diagnostic on the
  identifier (the document is valid, just unvalidated).
- **Outline / document symbols**, **folding ranges**, **selection ranges**, and **document
  highlights** — derived from an indentation scan of the source. (Stratiform positions are looked up
  by keyword *path*, which can't disambiguate same-keyword siblings, so the scan stays authoritative
  for ordered structure.) The scan recognises source-atom and literal-atom payloads (§14/§15)
  lexically, so payload lines never appear as compounds, and a compound's fold covers its payload.
- **Go-to-definition**, **find references**, and **hover** for named types — a `record`/`scalar`/
  `select` compound defines a type; a `field`/`variant` references one by its inline atom. Hover over
  the pragma reports the schema-resolution status: the resolved schema's name, signature and
  registry path (or the meta-schema, or why resolution failed).
- **Cross-file link-to-definition into the schema** — from a document that resolves to a registered
  schema, go-to-definition on a compound keyword jumps *across* into the schema file, at the
  `field`/`variant` that declares it (descending through record references for nested compounds), and
  go-to-definition on the pragma opens the schema file at its head. The target is the registry's copy,
  which is stored **read-only**, so an editor that honours filesystem permissions presents it read-only.
- **Schema-aware hover and completion** — when a document resolves to a registered schema, the server
  navigates the schema alongside the document's compound tree (descending into `record` references and
  flattening `select` variants):
  - **hover** is column-accurate: over a compound *keyword* it shows the member's type, cardinality
    (`optional`/`repeatable`), default, and **description**; over a *value atom* it shows what the
    schema says about that slot — the expected scalar type and validators (with the field's
    default), the matched `select` variant (or the admissible variants), or a record's
    atom-assignable flag members; over a built-in validator name on a `validate` line, its §21.5
    blurb. Every hover carries the hovered token's range.
  - **completion** is driven by the schema at the cursor's position (a space after a keyword
    triggers it):
    - at a **keyword** slot — the members valid for the enclosing struct (`field`s and flattened
      `select` variants), each with its type as the detail and its **description** as the
      documentation (atom-taking fields insert a trailing space);
    - at a **value** slot — the inline atoms the member's type admits: a select reference's
      variants, or a record's atom-assignable members (flag fields and flag-typed variants);
    - at the **pragma's identifier slot** — the registered schemas, labelled by name, inserting the
      BASE-256 signature;
    - and, because a schema document is itself checked against the built-in **meta-schema**, editing a
      schema completes meta-keywords (`record`, `field`, `validate`, …) at a keyword slot, the
      available **type names** (the document's own `record`/`scalar`/`select` definitions plus the
      built-ins `String`, `Identifier`, `TypeName`, `Sigil`, `Flag`) at a `field`/`variant` type
      slot, the **flags** (`optional`, `required`, `repeatable`, `irrepeatable`, derived from the
      meta-schema) after a member declaration, and the four built-in **validator names** on a
      `validate` line.
- **Refactoring code actions** — when the schema is known, two inverse rewrites between the
  presentations of a member (§20.2): **expand** moves a compound's last inline atom onto a child
  line under the member's keyword (`pet amy` → `pet` / `name amy`), and **inline** folds a
  first-child compound back onto its parent's line as an atom. Each action is offered **if and only
  if it is verified meaning-preserving**: the candidate text is generated, and both versions are
  parsed and type-assigned against the schema — the action appears only when both are error-free
  and yield the *same semantic model* (§18.2). This is what catches §20.8's trap: in the contact
  schema, `contact` / `  active` does NOT offer inlining, because as an atom `active` would re-bind
  to the never-skipped optional Scalar `label`; conversely expanding `contact active` offers
  `label active`, making the surprising positional binding explicit. Hard-gap lines (§10.3) are
  handled: the generated text places a hard gap wherever a value must stay one phrase — expanding
  `recipient  Spice Labs Inc.` yields a `name  Spice Labs Inc.` child, and inlining onto a line
  already in hard mode separates the new atom with a hard gap rather than merging it into the
  phrase before it. Lines with remarks or source/literal payloads are declined rather than risked.

The whole tool is a single object, `tel.TelServer`, in
[`src/core/tel.TelServer.scala`](src/core/tel.TelServer.scala). Its `main` dispatches on the
subcommand; `tel lsp` calls `exegesis.Lsp.listen`, which supplies the JSON-RPC dispatch, the
open-document store (applying the editor's incremental edits) and the stdio transport. Each feature
is a **registration** in that call — `opened`, `hover`, `complete()`, `definition`, … — and the
capabilities the server advertises are derived from exactly those registrations, so there is no
capabilities record to keep in step. Within a handler the current `document`, the `workspace`, the
`client` and the request's payload (`position`, `positions`, …) are ambient.

## Building and installing

Requires JDK 25 (Mill fetches it via `temurin:25`) on the path used by Mill.

```sh
make install    # builds the `tel` launcher and copies it to ~/.local/bin
which tel        # sanity check that it is on your PATH
tel lsp          # run the language server on stdio (Ctrl-C to stop)
```

Other targets: `make assembly` (just the JAR), `make run` (runs `tel lsp` via the launcher for a
manual JSON-RPC smoke test), `make dev` (watch-compile).

The tool runs as an [Ethereal](https://github.com/propensive/ethereal) resident daemon: the first
launch starts a background JVM and later launches reconnect to it, so editor restarts are fast. After
rebuilding `tel`, kill the stray daemon JVM (`pkill -f ethereal.name=tel`) or restart your editor so
the new binary takes effect.

## Watching the traffic: `tel lsp --log`

Because every `tel` invocation shares one daemon JVM, you can watch the messages a running server
receives from a second terminal:

```sh
tel lsp --log
```

Leave that running while your editor (or another `tel lsp`) drives the server; each JSON-RPC message
is printed as it arrives, one per line, tagged `recv` (client → server) or `send` (server → client):

```
recv {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize",...}
send {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"capabilities":...},"id":1}
recv {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"textDocument/didOpen",...}
send {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"textDocument/publishDiagnostics",...}
```

Press Ctrl-C to stop. It attaches to whichever daemon is running (starting one if necessary), so the
order you launch the editor and the logger doesn't matter. Note that stdout of the serving process is
reserved for the LSP wire protocol, which is why the log is exposed through this separate observer
rather than printed by the server itself.

## Using it from Zed

See [`../zed`](../zed) for the companion Zed extension (which launches `tel lsp`) and step-by-step
testing instructions.

## Schema resolution (how the LSP validates ordinary documents)

The LSP resolves a document's pragma schema against the registry and validates the document with
`Tel.Type.assign`. TEL's pragma grammar (§8) identifies a schema by a **LIRA reference**
(`domain/name`, optionally with a `:version` or `:tag` selector), optional **`+layer`
selections**, and/or a **bare BASE-256 signature**:

```tel
tel 1.0 propensive.dev/contact +postal ḡǼJûĿΫęôқδfΊzžμȑωûĺǑЬǨỵξϋ4SṽζẄǽOḁ
…
```

A reference resolves by its module-name tail against the registry's `<name>.tel` working copies —
the local-development behaviour of §8.2, where a bare reference is deliberately local-only — and a
signature is matched against each cached schema's base, selected, or fully-composed signature
(memoized per identification, invalidated when the registry directory changes). `+layer`
selections compose exactly the named layers, in the schema's declaration order; an unknown or
out-of-order selection is reported as `E124`. Schema *documents* (pragma references the pinned
meta-schema coordinate, `specification.tel/tels:2.0.0`) are validated against the built-in
meta-schema. When the pragma names a schema that matches nothing in the registry, the LSP says so:
an `Information` diagnostic (`schema-unresolved`) underlines the identifier, and hovering the
pragma explains the resolution status (resolved schema name, signature and registry path;
meta-schema; or the failure). The pragma's identifier slot also tab-completes to the registered
schemas, inserting the signature.

The **document outline** follows the compound structure of the document, classified by the
resolved schema where one is available (records as objects, scalars as strings, flags as
booleans, select variants as enum members; a schema document's declarations get their natural
kinds), and **hover** surfaces the schema's `description` text for the member or value under the
cursor.

## Testing

`mill tel.test.run` runs a Probably suite ([`tel.Tests`](src/test/tel.Tests.scala)) over the
server's pure handler functions — diagnostics, schema resolution, the structure scan (including
§14/§15 payload handling), hover and completion — against a throwaway schema registry. No JSON-RPC
transport is involved; for a live smoke test, drive `tel lsp` over stdio and watch with
`tel lsp --log`.

## Known gaps / next steps

- **Deeper schema validity** — `assign`/`fromTel` catch malformed schema *syntax*, and the LSP
  checks duplicate/built-in-colliding definition names itself (E210), but the remaining semantic
  E2xx (layer-merge errors, empty selects) need Stratiform's §20.1 schema-validity pass.
- **LIRA network resolution** — references resolve locally only (the registry stands in for the
  developer's working copies). Fetching a `:version`/`:tag` release through LIRA (reliquary's
  resolution delegate) and the pragma "rubber-stamp" code action — appending the resolved
  signature to make a bare-reference document portable — are the next round.
- **Formatting** (`tel.show`) and **rename**. Formatting is now within reach: Stratiform's §22.2
  machine-operation set is exposed through `open[Tel]`, including §22.3 canonical presentation.
- **Per-node structure ranges from positions** — outline/folding use a source scan because
  `tel.locate` resolves a keyword *path* (ambiguous for same-keyword siblings). The scan recognises
  source-atom/literal-atom payloads lexically, so payload lines are not mistaken for compounds.
- **Snippet completions** — Exegesis's `CompletionItem` has `insertText` but no `insertTextFormat`,
  so completions cannot yet carry `$1`-placeholder snippets.
- **TELP paths are not yet used.** Stratiform now implements the TELP path language
  ([`../spec/telp.md`](../spec/telp.md)) as `stratiform.Telp`, which addresses elements by keyword
  and by key value rather than positionally. Outline/folding still use the source scan (see above),
  and nothing yet exposes TELP to the editor — a `key`-aware go-to-definition or a "copy path here"
  command would be the natural first uses.
