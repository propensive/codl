# BinTEL Specification Draft

## Abstract

BinTEL is the binary encoding of the semantic model of a TEL document, as defined by the
[TEL Specification](spec.md). Every well-typed TEL document has exactly one BinTEL encoding; the
mapping is fully deterministic. A schema is itself a TEL document and therefore has a BinTEL
encoding.

BinTEL provides an unambiguous, compact serialization of the semantic model, suitable for hashing,
transmission, and schema identification.

## 1. Status

This document is a draft specification of BinTEL.

## 2. Conformance Language

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD
NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

## 3. Value Hash

The **value hash** of a TEL document is the SHA-256 digest of its BinTEL representation excluding
the magic number and schema signature — that is, the hash is computed over only the document root
encoding (§7). This is the general method for hashing any semantic TEL value, including schema
documents (which are themselves TEL documents, as defined in §20 of the TEL Specification).

When used in schema identifiers (see §8.1 of the TEL Specification), the hash is represented as a
BASE64-URL-encoded (no padding) string of 43 characters.

## 4. Integer Encoding

All counts and byte-lengths in BinTEL are non-negative integers encoded in a variable-length format.
To encode an integer N:

1. Set B = N & 0x7F (the seven least-significant bits of N).
2. Set N = N >> 7.
3. If N > 0, set bit 7 of B (i.e. B = B | 0x80) and write the byte B; then repeat from step 1.
4. If N = 0, write B as the final byte (bit 7 is clear).

The result is one or more bytes. Every byte except the last has bit 7 set (a **continuation byte**).
The last byte has bit 7 clear. The seven low-order bits of each byte, concatenated from
least-significant (first byte) to most-significant (last byte), reconstruct the original integer.

Decoding: read bytes in sequence; for each byte, take bits 0–6 and OR them into the accumulator at
the current bit offset; advance the bit offset by 7. If bit 7 of the byte is set, read the next
byte; otherwise the integer is complete.

| Value | Encoded bytes (hex) |
| ----: | ------------------- |
|     0 | `00`                |
|     1 | `01`                |
|   127 | `7F`                |
|   128 | `80 01`             |
|   255 | `FF 01`             |
| 16383 | `FF 7F`             |
| 16384 | `80 80 01`          |

## 5. Keyword Index

The keyword index used in BinTEL node encoding is the position of a keyword in keyword order, as
defined in §20 of the TEL Specification. Because the schema determines the type of every node from
its keyword index and its parent's type, BinTEL encodes no type tags.

## 6. File Layout

A BinTEL file consists of the following fields in order:

1. **Magic number**: the 2 bytes `C0 D1`
2. **Schema signature**: the byte length of the signature (integer), followed by the signature
   bytes. The schema signature identifies the composed schema (base plus layers) used to type the
   document. Its construction is defined in §8.
3. **Document root**: encoded as described in §7 (root form).

## 7. Node Encoding

**Document root.** The root is a virtual struct with no parent keyword. It is encoded as:

1. The number of top-level child nodes (integer).
2. Each top-level child node in order, using the struct, primitive, or flag encoding below.

**Struct node** (schema type is `Struct`, as defined in the TEL Specification):

1. The keyword index of this node (integer).
2. The number of child nodes (integer).
3. Each child node in order, recursively.

**Primitive node** (schema type is `Primitive`):

1. The keyword index of this node (integer).
2. The byte length of the UTF-8 encoding of the value string (integer).
3. The UTF-8-encoded bytes of the value string.

**Flag node** (schema type is `Flag`):

1. The keyword index of this node (integer).

**Default values.** BinTEL encodes the semantic model, in which a required `Primitive` member with a
non-null default is semantically present even when it was absent from the source document.
Therefore, when encoding a document to BinTEL, a missing required primitive whose default is used
MUST be encoded as a primitive node with the default value string. This ensures that the BinTEL
encoding is identical regardless of whether the member was explicitly written or filled by its
default.

There are no pad bytes, alignment constraints, or inter-node delimiters. The schema provides all
type information needed to decode the stream unambiguously.

## 8. Schema Signature

A schema signature identifies a composed schema as an ordered sequence of components: a base schema
followed by zero or more layers. Each component is identified by its value hash (§3).

A schema document (a TEL document conforming to the `tel-schema` schema; see §20 of the TEL
Specification) defines a base schema and zero or more layers. Each component's hash is its value
hash (§3): the component is encoded as a BinTEL document root (§7) and the SHA-256 digest is taken
over that root encoding alone, without the magic number or schema signature.

**Encoding.** Given an ordered sequence of n component hashes h₀, h₁, …, h_{n−1} (each 256 bits),
the signature is computed as follows:

1. Let S = 0 (a zero-valued integer of unbounded width).
2. For each hash hᵢ, in order from i = 0 to i = n−1: a. Set S = (S << 8) XOR hᵢ.
3. The result S has a width of 256 + (n−1)×8 bits, or equivalently 31 + n bytes.

Emit the signature as `31 + n` bytes, most-significant byte first.

**Correctness property.** Because each shift is only 8 bits wide but each hash is 256 bits wide, the
lowest 8 bits of S are determined solely by the last hash h_{n−1}. After XORing h_{n−1} out of S
and shifting right by 8 bits, the lowest 8 bits are determined solely by h_{n−2}. This property
holds at every step, enabling unambiguous decoding.

**Decoding.** Given a signature S of known byte length L, and a set of candidate hashes H (the value
hashes of all components defined in the schema file):

1. Compute n = L − 31. This is the number of components.
2. Let the output sequence be empty.
3. Repeat n times: a. Let b = S & 0xFF (the lowest byte of S). b. Find all hashes in H whose lowest
   byte equals b. c. For each candidate hash h: compute S′ = (S XOR h) >> 8. d. Recurse with S = S′
   and the candidate h appended to the front of the output sequence.
4. When n steps have been completed, S MUST be zero. If S ≠ 0, the candidate path is invalid;
   backtrack and try the next candidate.
5. Exactly one valid sequence MUST exist. If no valid sequence is found, or if more than one is
   found, the signature is malformed.

The decoded sequence gives the component hashes in order: h₀ (base schema), h₁ (first layer), …,
h_{n−1} (last layer). A BinTEL decoder uses this sequence to locate and compose the schema before
decoding the document root.

Schema compatibility is defined in §8.2 of the TEL Specification in terms of subsequence
relationships between decoded signature hash sequences.
