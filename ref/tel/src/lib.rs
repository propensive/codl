//! TEL reference implementation.
//!
//! This crate implements the [TEL Specification](../../../spec/tel.md):
//!
//! - **Parser** (`parse`) producing the presentation model of §17: `Document` ⊃ `Block` ⊃
//!   `Compound` with attached `Atom`, `Tabulation`, `Comment`, and `Remark` nodes.
//! - **Schema model** (`Schema`, `Layer`, `Definition`, `Struct`, `Scalar`, `Flag`, `Field`,
//!   `Select`, `Variant`, `Member::Exclude`) of §20.
//! - **Type assignment** (`type_assign`) implementing §20.2's atom-then-compound algorithm,
//!   the §20.1 schema-validity checks, and the §21 validator-callback model.
//! - **Schema composition** (`compose_schema`) implementing §20.3's MergeStruct algorithm,
//!   producing the subtype guaranteed by §24.4.
//! - **Indentation recovery** for E107 / E111 per §19.5.
//! - **Built-in `tels`** (`builtin_tels`) with pinned BinTEL value hash per §20.5.
//!
//! Sub-modules: [`bintel`] (§7 of BinTEL Specification), [`canonical`] (§22.3),
//! [`mutate`] (§22.2 machine operations), [`resolver`] (§8.2 schema resolution),
//! [`base256`] (BASE-256 codec).
